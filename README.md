## Installation
```bash
# With npm
$ npm install @microkits/microbus

# With yarn
$ yarn add @microkits/microbus
```

## Payloads

A payload is a representation of an object that needs to be sent to another application. It is defined as a Typescript class that will be converted to a Buffer and transmitted over a transporter.

```typescript

import {Payload} from "@microkits/microbus";

export class MessagePayload extends Payload<string> {
  constructor(message: string) {
    super({
      type: "MESSAGE", 
      body: message
    });
  }
}
```

## Sending a payload

```typescript
import {Microbus} from "@microkits/microbus";

const microbus = new Microbus({
  // see below in this page what this means
  transporter, serializer, cryptography 
});

const payload = new Payload({
  type: "MESSAGE",
  body: "Hi, I'm traveling around the world in a microbus! üåéüöê"
})

microbus.send({ payload }, "receiver_id");

// Also is possible to broadcast a payload:

microbus.broadcast({ payload });
```

## Receiving a payload 

```typescript
import {Microbus} from "@microkits/microbus";

const microbus = new Microbus({
  // see below in this page what this means
  transporter, serializer, cryptography 
});

// MESSAGE is the payload type
microbus.addHandler<string>("MESSAGE", (request) => {
  const payload = request.payload;
  const sender = request.sender;
  
  console.log(`received message ${payload.body} from ${sender}`);
});
```
Or
```typescript
import {Microbus, Request} from "@microkits/microbus";

const microbus = new Microbus({
  // see below in this page what this means
  transporter, serializer, cryptography 
});

// MESSAGE is the payload type
microbus.addHandler("MESSAGE", (request: Request<string>) => {
  const payload = request.payload;
  const sender = request.sender;

  console.log(`received message ${payload.body} from ${sender}`);
});
```

## Replying to a payload

To reply to a payload, just return a payload in the handler function. The returned payload will be sent directly to the sender.

```typescript
microbus.addHandler<string>("MESSAGE", (request) => {
  const packet = request.packet;
  const sender = request.sender;
  ...
  // Will be sent to sender
  return new Payload({
    type: "MESSAGE",
    body: "Ok, this is really awesome!"
  });
});
```

## Packets
Packets are internal objects that represent the information that will be sent by transporters. They contain an id and the payload to be transported and need to be serialized before being sent.

## Transporter
A transporter is responsible for defining the communication between different applications, sending and receiving buffers. 

Need to extends `Transporter` class and implements the following properties:

```typescript
abstract id: string;
abstract start(): Promise<Transporter>;
abstract stop(): Promise<void>;
abstract send(buffer: Buffer, receiver?: string): Promise<void>;
```

It is required to emit a `data` event when a packet is received.
The `Transporter` has the following events:

```typescript
data: (buffer: Buffer, sender: string, broadcast: boolean) => void; //  emitted when a packet is received
disconnect: () => void; // emitted when the transporter is disconnected
```

Example:

```typescript
import * as mqtt from "mqtt";
import {Transporter} from "@microkits/microbus";

interface Options {
  id: string;
  url?: string;
  delimiter?: string;
}

export class MqttTransporter extends Transporter {
  readonly id: string;
  private client: mqtt.MqttClient;
  private delimiter: string;
  private url: string;

  constructor(options: Options) {
    super();
    this.id = options.id;
    this.delimiter = options.delimiter || "/";
    this.url = options.url || "mqtt://localhost:1883";
  }

  private getTopicName(sender: string, receiver: string) {
    return [sender, receiver].join(this.delimiter)
  }
  
  private getSender(topic: string) {
    return topic.split(this.delimiter)[0];
  }

  private getReceiver(topic: string) {
    return topic.split(this.delimiter)[1];
  }

  async start(): Promise<Transporter> {
    return new Promise<Transporter>((resolve, reject) => {
      this.client = mqtt.connect(this.url);

      this.client.on("connect", () => {
        this.client.subscribe(this.getTopicName("+", this.id));
        this.client.subscribe(this.getTopicName("+", "ALL"));
        resolve(this);
      })

      this.client.on("message", (topic, buffer) => {
        const sender = this.getSender(topic);
        const receiver = this.getReceiver(topic);
        const broadcast = receiver == "ALL";
        this.emit("data", buffer, sender, broadcast);
      })

      this.client.on("error", (error) => {
        if (!this.client.connected) {
          reject(error)
        }
      })
    })
  }

  async stop() {
    this.emit("disconnect");
    this.client.end();
  }

  async send(buffer: Buffer, receiver: string = "ALL") {
    const topic = this.getTopicName(this.id, receiver);
    this.client.publish(topic, buffer)
  }
}
```

## Serializer
Serializers allow packets to be converted to buffers and from buffers back to packets. 
It is necessary to implement the `Serializer` interface, with the following methods:

```typescript
serialize(packet: Packet): Buffer
deserialize(buffer: Buffer): Packet
```

Example:

```typescript
import {Packet, Serializer} from "@microkits/microbus";

export class JsonSerializer implements Serializer {
  serialize(packet: Packet): Buffer {
    const buffer = Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(packet));
    return buffer;
  }

  deserialize(buffer: Buffer): Packet {
    const packet: Packet = JSON.parse(buffer.toString());
    return packet
  }
}
```

## Cryptography 
There is the possibility of implementing encryption to data transported in microbus.
To do this, you must implement the `CryptographyStrategy` interface and implement the following methods: 

```typescript
decrypt(data: Buffer): Buffer;
encrypt(data: Buffer): Buffer;
```

Example: 

```typescript
import {CryptographyStrategy} from "@microkits/microbus";
import crypto from "crypto";

export class AES256CTR implements CryptographyStrategy {
  private readonly key: string;

  constructor(key: string) {
    this.key = key;
  }

  encrypt(data: Buffer): Buffer {
    const iv = crypto.randomBytes(16);
    const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv('AES-256-CTR', Buffer.from(this.key), iv)

    return Buffer.concat([iv, cipher.update(data), cipher.final()]);
  }

  decrypt(data: Buffer): Buffer {
    const iv = data.slice(0, 16);
    const decipher = crypto.createDecipheriv('AES-256-CTR', Buffer.from(this.key), iv)

    return Buffer.concat([decipher.update(data.slice(16)), decipher.final()]);
  }
}
```
